## Objective
The NFL Big Data Bowl is an annual analytics competition hosted on Kaggle. 
The 2026 challenge focuses on analyzing **NFL player tracking data** to generate predicative models that improve understanding of the game. 

My participation goal is to practice advanced data analysis techniques, apply machine learning methods to a real-world dataset, and expand my professional portfolio. 

## Motivation
While a strong leaderboard score would be a plus, the main reason for entering this competition is professional growth. 

- Maintain momentum in applying/sharpening analysis skills.
- Practice structured problem-soling under real-world constraints.
- Expand portfolio with applied projects that showcase data storytelling and
  reproducible workflows.
- Demonstrate continuous learning and adaptability for professional development.

---

## Current Progress
- Completed initial cleaning exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Built and submitted a baseline regression model (scored `0.482` on private
  leaderboard).
- Set up repo structure with (Kaggle embedded) Jupyter notebooks for experiments
  and visualizations.

---

## Next Steps
- Engineer richer player, and game-level features.
- Experiment with advanced models (XBoost, Random Forest, neural networks).
- Create visualizations to highlight insights and trends.
- Track progress and document iterations for transparency.

---

## Skills & Tools 
- Languages: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn).
- Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost.
- Data Management: Jupyter, Git/GitHub, Kaggle Notebooks.
- Focus Areas: Feature engineering, model evaluation, data storytelling.

---

## Current Focus
This repository currently prioritizes:
- Structuring the workflow for efficient iteration.
- Experimenting with feature engineering approaches.
- Sharing transparent updates through committed notebooks.
